I recently developed an interactive Cryptography System using Python and the customtkinter library. This project encompasses multiple classic encryption algorithms, providing an insightful exploration of the foundations of cryptography.
 Functionality:
Encrypt and Decrypt messages using the chosen algorithm.
Upload and Download text files for encryption and decryption, enhancing usability.
